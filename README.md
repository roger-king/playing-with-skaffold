# Playing with Skaffold

Local development has really changed through out the last few years. With the evolution of docker and kubernetes. I have always been a firm believer of running your application in an environment as close to production.

# Enter Skaffold

Google created skaffold. Skaffold is a tool to help you develop your application within your docker container and run in a kubernetes cluster!
